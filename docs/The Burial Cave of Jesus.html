These books tell of the life, the preaching, the death and the resurrection of

Freemason, triple Oscar winner and film-maker James Cameron (with the films <i>Titanic
</i>and <i>The Terminator </i>to his credit) and the originally Israeli but now
Canadian documentary-maker Simcha Jacobovici. Both these gentleman are sending
shockwaves around the world with the statement that there is <i>“scientific
evidence” </i>that they have located the grave of Jesus of Nazareth. In a
90-minute documentary entitled “The Burial Cave of Jesus” they proclaim that

as 1980. The gentlemen in question base their findings on years of
investigations by archaeologists, historians, writing experts and DNA
specialists. In the small cave experts found ten remains of caskets with –
among others – the following names engraved upon them: Jesus, son of <st1:place

alleged to have been married to Mary Magdalene and they had a son called <st1:place

Jacobovici is of the opinion that the discovery does not need <i>“to change
belief in Jesus”</i>. He says that we can most certainly speak of <span
class=GramE>an ascension</span> into heaven – though spiritual rather than
physical. What an incredible fool! The media world-wide published the news on
the front pages, and various international TV broadcasters also paid it
extensive attention. A BBC documentary in 1966 was the first to suggest that it
was the grave of Jesus and His family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

serious criticism, and not just from Christians and Muslims but is also
rejected by a growing band of unprejudiced scientists.The prominent Israeli
archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was responsible in 1980 for the excavations in
and around the tomb, rejected the film as <i>“nonsense”</i>. Kloner
investigated the graves thoroughly and deciphered the inscriptions, and
characterises the claims as <i>“a great story for a</i> <i>TV film”</i>, but
says that any evidence is lacking. As early as 1996 Professor Kloner published
his findings in the Israeli journal Atigot: <i>“The names on the graves may be
the same as those of the</i> <i>family of Jesus of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Nazareth</st1:place></st1:City>; for one thing, all the names
discovered were very common among</i> <i>the Jews in the first centuries before
and after Christ.” </i>Kloner rejects the combination of names as a
coincidence. The IAA (Israel Antiquities Authority), the Israeli authority
responsible for antiquities, is keeping the caskets in its archives in Beit
Shemesh and refuses to comment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

more accounts will come denying the existence of a risen Jesus. Before His
return it must be made clear to the world that His death, resurrection and His
return should be regarded as a mere fairy tale. Eventually many Christians will
start to see Jesus as nothing more than one of the many “Teachers of the
World”, in the same league as Buddha, <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>,
Mohammed and others. The Antichrist will claim to be the true Saviour and the
people will believe him and follow him en masse. Those preparing the way for
the Antichrist will do everything in their power to ban the belief in Christ
from the world. <i><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>James’ ossuarium

casket) of James, suggesting that it contained James’ bones. In October 2002 an
article in the journal “Biblical Archaeology Review” attracted attention when
the French palaeographer André Lemaire of the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sorbonne</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City> made it known that he had discovered a
limestone ossuarium dated 63 AD bearing the Aramaic inscription: <i>“James, son
of Joseph, brother of Jesus”. </i>It was said to be the oldest reference to the
existence of Jesus. The “Israel Antiquities Authority” (IAA) examined the
ossuarium and its inscription and stated on 18th June 2003 during a press
conference that the ossuarium itself was real but the inscription as a whole
was fake: <i>“The inscription is not</i> <i>genuine, but is written in modern
characters by someone trying to imitate the ancient characters”.</i>The casket
is probably <i>“of Christian origin” </i>dating from the time after Luke and
Matthew had written their Gospels. Even if the ossuarium does indeed date from
the first century, there is still no proof that it refers to the Jesus of the
Bible. The owner of the casket, the Israeli collector Oded Golan, states that
he bought it in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>
for about 200 dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all the world’s major news publications. National Geographic paid around a
million dollars for the restoration and the rights to publish the text and to
tell the story of its discovery.The newspaper <i>USA Today </i>announced: <i>“Long-lost
gospel of Judas recasts ‘traitor’”.</i>The Gospel of Judas is a 26-page codex
placing Judas in a positive light as the one disciple who really understood
Jesus, and betrayed Him only because he was instructed to do so. The document
was discovered in a sandstone tomb, in the neighbourhood of the Egyptian place
of El-Minya. It is written in Coptic, the language spoken and written by the

According to this movement a god named Hystera created the world and another
divinity, named Sophia, who – it is said – assisted the aforementioned people.
Some of those who explained this gospel stated that its discovery would
contribute to a considerable positive re-evaluation of Judas, making it no
longer possible for him to be seen as a traitor. He is alleged to have freed
Jesus from his earthly body by giving Him up for crucifixion so that Jesus
could continue His existence as a spiritual entity. <span class=GramE>Thus a

different from that stated in Genesis and that an ‘evil god’ named Nebro, rules
the lower world of men. Judas is the ‘thirteenth spirit’ appointed to free
Jesus from the physical body in which he was imprisoned. The Gospel of Judas
celebrates Judas rather than Jesus: he goes into a ‘radiant cloud’. The Gnostic
Jesus in this document is not the Almighty God or Creator of the world; He did
not die for the sins of men and did not rise bodily from the dead. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>, where
the majority of such writings originate, was a breeding ground of apostasy and
fanaticism in the early centuries AD. Many other strange gospels, inspired by
the Devil, were written there, including the Gospel of Thomas that pretends to
give details of the childhood of Jesus. Up till now something like thirty-five
such gospels are known, some of them discovered in Nag Hammadi in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1945.
The novelist Dan Brown also found inspiration in these discoveries for his “Da
Vinci Code”. The Gnostics represented a very early movement – in fact, a
perverse twisting of the truth and a direct attack on God’s Word. The Gospel of
Judas is nothing more than slander and a frontal attack on the person of Jesus
and His followers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

opponents to destroy the belief in Jesus. Satan uses lying miracles and false
evidence to attain his goal. The ‘lord of the strongholds’ uses every weapon in
his armoury to deny the resurrection of Jesus and has at his disposal a
veritable army of lackeys and fools for that purpose. Over the centuries many
attempts have been made but in recent years we have seen an increasing number
of denials of the resurrection of Jesus. Among the elite in the West you are
more credible if you doubt the Bible and the belief in the Living God of Israel
or, better still, if you reject it totally. It is alleged that belief in the
person of Jesus Christ has caused the world to stray. Across the centuries the
resurrection of Jesus has been reasoned to be <span class=GramE>an impossibility</span>,
as a fairy tale that ended badly for Jesus. But Jesus went bravely to the altar
of sacrifice. His only expectation, as He well knew, was insults and ridicule
by the people, torture and scorn, but also a glorious victory as a closing
event of his mission<span class=GramE>.<i><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

not at all about God’s Word. People simply do not wish to believe God’s

He ends up by hiding the Lord away to such an extent that the greatest
foolishness appears to him as his personal happiness. He is no longer capable
of denying his foolishness. God selects for Himself a people that, despite all,

is a Greek word meaning ‘knowledge’, knowledge that is above ordinary knowledge
or belief that rests on divine inspiration. The Gnosis is a central concept of
religious or philosophical movements from the late ancient world and the early
centuries of Christianity. The basic assumption of the Gnosis is that we can
attain a perfect and absolute form of knowledge, separate from biblical
revelation, whereby we can solve all problems relative to God, Man and the
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
